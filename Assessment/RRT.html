    <h2>Ransomware Readiness Tutorial</h2>
    
    <div class="panel-body">
        Ransomware is an ever-evolving form of malware designed to encrypt files on a device, rendering any files and the systems that rely on them unusable. Malicious actors then demand ransom in exchange for decryption. Ransomware actors often target and threaten to sell or leak exfiltrated data or authentication information if the ransom is not paid. In recent years, ransomware incidents have become increasingly prevalent among the Nation’s state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) government entities and critical infrastructure organizations.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="panel-body">
        Malicious actors continue to adjust and evolve their ransomware tactics over time, and CISA analysts remain vigilant in maintaining awareness of ransomware attacks and associated tactics, techniques, and procedures across the country and around the world.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="panel-body">
        This Ransomware Readiness Assessment (RRA) will help you understand your cybersecurity posture with respect to the ever-evolving threat of ransomware. The RRA also provides a clear path for improvement, and contains an evolving progression of questions tiered by the categories of basic, intermediate, and advanced. This is intended to help an organization improve by focusing on the basics first, and then progressing by implementing practices through the intermediate and advanced categories.

    <div class="panel-body">
        The NEW Ransomware Guide is a great place to start. The Guide, released in September 2020, represents a joint effort between CISA and the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC). The joint Ransomware Guide includes industry best practices and a response checklist that can serve as a ransomware-specific addendum to organization cyber incident response plans.

    <div class="panel-body">
        In January 2021, CISA unveiled the Reduce the Risk of Ransomware Campaign to raise awareness and instigate actions to combat this ongoing and evolving threat. The campaign is a focused, coordinated and sustained effort to encourage public and private sector organizations to implement best practices, tools and resources that can help them mitigate ransomware risk.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="panel-body">
        For critical infrastructure owners and operators of industrial control systems, CISA published a Fact Sheet, Rising Ransomware Threat to Operational Technology Assets, that provides information on the rising risk of ransomware to ICS and recommended actions to reduce the risk of becoming a victim as well as severe business or functional degradation should they fall victim.

    <H4>Ransomware Readiness Assessment Composition: Goals and Practice Questions</H4>

    <div class="panel-body">
        This assessment represents one Domain that addresses Ransomware and is constructed with ten Goals and Practice Questions that address each Goal.
    </div>
        <br>
    <div class="panel-body">
        The Practice Questions are tiered as Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced. Each question contains an identifier structured as follows:
    </div>
        <br>
    <div class="panel-body">
            Goal [GG] : Level [B,I,A] . Question Number [Q##]            
    </div>
        <br>
    <div class="panel-body">
        An example of the above structure is AM:I.Q03, which represents Asset Management, Level “Intermediate,” Question Number 3.
    </div>
        <br>
    <div class="panel-body">
        The blue oval beneath each identifier indicates the Basic, Intermediate, or Advanced tier for the question.

    <br>
    <H4><b>Implementation approach:</b></H4>
    <div class="panel-body">    
    Organizations that are unfamiliar with ransomware and need to begin basic cyber hygiene safeguards against ransomware threats should focus on implementing the basic tier of practices.
    After completing the basic tier of the improvement effort, organizations looking to further improve their risk posture against ransomware should implement the intermediate tier of practices.
    Organizations that have already adopted basic and intermediate level RRA practices and are looking to improve their response to ransomware threats should focus on adopting the practices in the Advanced Tier.
    </div> 
    <br> 
    <div class="panel-body">
    This suggested path to improvement can always be adapted by the organization to suit its own needs.

    <div class="panel-body">
    Each practice question contains a yes/no response scale to evaluate whether the organization has implemented each practice:
